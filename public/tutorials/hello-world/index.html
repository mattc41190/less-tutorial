      <h1>Hello Less CSS</h1>
      <p>In this exercise we wrote a simple less file utilizing a variable and used that variable to assign a color to our H1 tag. To get less to compile on our page we included a CDN link to less.js and included a less file directly on the page. This method of compiling less is only recommended for development</p>
      <p>In the next tutorial we will use a mixin to keep our styles DRY</p>
